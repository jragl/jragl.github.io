            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been fascinated and compelled by technology for as long as I can remember. Things that we take for granted every day, like television, cellular communications, and the internet are magnets to me. We don’t question how they work, just get irritated when they don’t. It has taken me a lifetime to realize that the way we interface with technology is what I’ve been drawn to.<br><br></p>
            <p>I didn’t know I wanted to learn UX design until one day I was reflecting on a consulting project, trying to reimagine a simpler way for a client to work with an SAP database to accomplish their job. I could clearly visualize what needed to exist, but I didn’t know how to make it happen. Being a life-long learner, I quickly researched what I was visualizing and learned that UX design was actually what I was describing. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br></p>
            <p>UX design is a natural fit for me. I can apply what I’ve learned, as well as an accumulated lifetime of experience, towards creating interfaces that make accessing digital data intuitive and engaging. A goal for me is to design a UX interface that allows users to find things they didn’t even know they were looking for. A lofty goal to be sure, but equally worthy!<br><br></p>
            <p>Conducting critical analysis and research on existing user processes and then applying that information to improve the process is extremely satisfying. Even more satisfying is to identify and create entirely new processes that greatly simplify necessary tasks. Again, UX design to the rescue. - -<br><br></p>
            <p>As an example, I am currently working on a project that requires gathering and organizing several years’ worth of accumulated data from hundreds of users and then creating a way to leverage that data. A major portion of this project involves UX design, particularly research as to how users will search this data. Every user is thoroughly invested in their data and has an opinion on how it should be used. Being able to capture their intent for the data and then making it easily findable and reusable by others has tremendous promise to significantly grow the organization as a whole. Wow!<br><br></p>
            <p>Solving this problem excites and energizes me. I realize I’m a long way from completing this assignment and am seriously enjoying applying the skills I’ve learned in UX design in solving it, but I can’t wait for the next one! If the next one involves you, give me a shout.</p>
